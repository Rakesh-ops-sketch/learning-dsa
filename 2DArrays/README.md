# 2D Arrays

In this section you could find below mentioned problems.

- Wave printing of 2D Arrays.
    ```
    example : 

        10 20  30  40
        50 60  70  80
        90 100 110 120

    Printing above matrix in wave form will be : 
        
        10 50 90 100 60 20 30 70 110 120 80 40
     ```

- Spiral Printing of 2D Arrays.
    ```
    example : 

        10 20  30  40
        50 60  70  80
        90 100 110 120

    Printing above matrix in spiral form will be : 

        10 20 30 40 80 120 110 100 90 50 60 70

    ```
